                <p>Newton's laws of motion form the foundation of classical mechanics and describe the relationship between forces and motion.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Newton's three laws of motion revolutionized our understanding of how objects move:</p>

                        <h4>First Law: Law of Inertia</h4>
                        <p>An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction, unless acted upon by an external force.</p>
