        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Vectors can be added by combining their components:</p>
            <p>\( \vec{a} + \vec{b} = (a_x + b_x, a_y + b_y, a_z + b_z) \)</p>
            <p>Geometrically, this is represented by the parallelogram rule or tip-to-tail method.</p>

            <p>In the visualization, drag the vectors to see how their sum changes. Notice that vector addition is commutative: \( \vec{a} + \vec{b} = \vec{b} + \vec{a} \).</p>

        <h2>Scalar Multiplication</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its magnitude while preserving its direction (or reversing it if the scalar is negative):</p>
            <p>\( c\vec{v} = (cv_x, cv_y, cv_z) \)</p>
            <p>When c > 1, the vector is stretched. When 0 < c < 1, the vector is shortened.</p>
            <p>When c < 0, the vector points in the opposite direction.</p>
