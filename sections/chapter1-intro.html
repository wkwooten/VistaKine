        <h2>Navigating 3D Space</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Welcome to your first interactive lesson! This section introduces the basic concepts of 3D coordinate systems. Understanding how to navigate and represent points in three-dimensional space is fundamental to visualizing physics concepts.</p>

            <p>The interactive visualization below demonstrates a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rotate:</strong> Click and drag with your mouse</li>
                <li><strong>Zoom:</strong> Use your scroll wheel or pinch gesture</li>
                <li><strong>Pan:</strong> Hold Shift while dragging</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Try each of these controls to get comfortable with 3D navigation.</p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <div class="section-text">
            <p>In the visualization above, notice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <span style="color: #ff0000">X-axis</span> (red), <span style="color: #00ff00">Y-axis</span> (green), and <span style="color: #0000ff">Z-axis</span> (blue) extend from the origin point (0,0,0).</li>
                <li>The orange point at coordinates (2,3,1) shows how a position is specified in 3D space.</li>
                <li>The dashed lines show how this point's position is determined by its distance along each axis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Click the expand button in the top-right corner of the visualization to view it in fullscreen mode for a more immersive experience.</p>

        <h2>The Cartesian Coordinate System</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>The Cartesian coordinate system uses three perpendicular axes to specify positions in 3D space. This system, named after mathematician Ren√© Descartes, provides a standardized way to describe locations in space.</p>

            <p>Each position is defined by three coordinates (x, y, z) that represent distances along each axis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>x-coordinate:</strong> Distance along the x-axis (left/right)</li>
                <li><strong>y-coordinate:</strong> Distance along the y-axis (up/down in most 3D software)</li>
                <li><strong>z-coordinate:</strong> Distance along the z-axis (forward/backward)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In physics and mathematics, we typically use a <strong>right-handed coordinate system</strong>. You can visualize this by pointing your right thumb along the positive x-axis, your index finger along the positive y-axis, and your middle finger along the positive z-axis, with all fingers perpendicular to each other.</p>

            <p>This coordinate system forms the foundation for all the concepts we'll explore in this course, including vectors, forces, and motion in three-dimensional space.</p>
