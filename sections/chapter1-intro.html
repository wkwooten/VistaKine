        <h2>Navigating 3D Space</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Welcome to your first interactive lesson! This section introduces the basic concepts of 3D coordinate systems. Understanding how to navigate and represent points in three-dimensional space is fundamental to visualizing physics concepts.</p>

            <p>The interactive visualization below demonstrates a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rotate:</strong> Click and drag with your mouse</li>
                <li><strong>Zoom:</strong> Use your scroll wheel or pinch gesture</li>
                <li><strong>Pan:</strong> Hold Shift while dragging</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Try each of these controls to get comfortable with 3D navigation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-text">
            <p>In the visualization above, notice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <span style="color: #ff0000">X-axis</span> (red), <span style="color: #00ff00">Y-axis</span> (green), and <span style="color: #0000ff">Z-axis</span> (blue) extend from the origin point (0,0,0).</li>
                <li>The orange point at coordinates (2,3,1) shows how a position is specified in 3D space.</li>
                <li>The dashed lines show how this point's position is determined by its distance along each axis.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>The Cartesian Coordinate System</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>The Cartesian coordinate system uses three perpendicular axes to specify positions in 3D space. This system, named after mathematician René Descartes, provides a standardized way to describe locations in space.</p>

            <p>Each position is defined by three coordinates (x, y, z) that represent distances along each axis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>x-coordinate:</strong> Distance along the x-axis (left/right)</li>
                <li><strong>y-coordinate:</strong> Distance along the y-axis (up/down in most 3D software)</li>
                <li><strong>z-coordinate:</strong> Distance along the z-axis (forward/backward)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In physics and mathematics, we typically use a <strong>right-handed coordinate system</strong>. You can visualize this by pointing your right thumb along the positive x-axis, your index finger along the positive y-axis, and your middle finger along the positive z-axis, with all fingers perpendicular to each other.</p>

            <p>This coordinate system forms the foundation for all the concepts we'll explore in this course, including vectors, forces, and motion in three-dimensional space.</p>

        <h2>What Are Vectors?</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Vectors are mathematical objects that have both magnitude and direction. They are used to represent quantities that have both a size and a direction, such as velocity, force, or displacement.</p>

            <p>Vectors can be represented graphically as arrows in space, with the length of the arrow representing the magnitude of the vector and the direction of the arrow representing the direction of the vector.</p>

        <h2>Why Vectors Matter in Physics</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Vectors are essential in physics because they allow us to describe and analyze motion, forces, and other physical quantities in a precise and consistent manner.</p>

            <p>For example, in mechanics, vectors are used to describe the position, velocity, and acceleration of objects. In electromagnetism, vectors are used to describe electric and magnetic fields. In fluid dynamics, vectors are used to describe fluid flow.</p>
