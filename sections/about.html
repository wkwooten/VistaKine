        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Begin your journey by exploring a chapter that interests you from the sidebar navigation. Each chapter builds on previous concepts, but feel free to jump to topics that catch your attention.</p>

            <p>As you explore, you'll discover interactive 3D models that you can rotate, zoom, and manipulate to build intuition. Experiment freely—the best learning happens through exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for expandable sections, interactive elements, and the fullscreen option on visualizations for a more immersive experience.</p>

        <h2>Our Story & Mission</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>Our mission:</strong> VistaKine makes abstract physics concepts tangible through interactive 3D visualizations, engaging multiple senses to help students build stronger mental models and deeper understanding.</p>

            <p>VistaKine was born from the realization that traditional textbooks often fall short in building intuition for complex physics concepts.</p>

            <div class="desktop-only" id="story-extra">
                <p>When I was a mechanical engineering student, I spent countless hours poring over dense textbooks, working through problem sets, and trying to visualize complex physical systems in my mind. While I found satisfaction in solving difficult problems, I often felt that traditional learning methods weren't optimized for building true understanding.</p>

                <p>The interactive problems in some assignments were where I learned the most. By experimenting with the physics—changing variables and seeing immediate results—I developed intuition that no static textbook could provide. However, these experiences often felt limited, with clunky interfaces and restricted interaction.</p>

                <p>By combining rigorous content with immersive, well-designed 3D visualizations, we create learning experiences that are fundamentally more effective at building deep understanding.</p>
