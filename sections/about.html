        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>VistaKine is dedicated to making abstract mathematical and physical concepts tangible through interactive 3D visualizations.</p>
            <p>We believe that by engaging multiple senses and allowing direct manipulation of concepts, students can build stronger mental models and deeper understanding.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to make physics education more engaging, intuitive, and effective through interactive experiences that foster genuine understanding rather than rote memorization.</p>
            <p>We believe that truly understanding physics concepts requires more than just solving equations—it demands developing a feel for how systems behave and respond to changes. By providing interactive simulations with thoughtful UX design, we aim to help students build that intuition in a way that's both educational and enjoyable.</p>

        <h2>The Story Behind VistaKine</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>When I was a mechanical engineering student, I spent countless hours poring over dense textbooks, working through problem sets, and trying to visualize complex physical systems in my mind. While I found satisfaction in solving difficult problems, I often felt that traditional learning methods weren't optimized for building true understanding.</p>
            <p>The interactive problems in some assignments were where I learned the most. By experimenting with the physics—changing variables and seeing immediate results—I developed intuition that no static textbook could provide. However, these experiences often felt limited, with clunky interfaces and restricted interaction.</p>
            <p>VistaKine was born from this realization: that by combining the rigorous content of traditional textbooks with immersive, well-designed 3D visualizations, we could create learning experiences that are not just more engaging, but fundamentally more effective at building deep understanding.</p>

        <h2>How to Use This Book</h2>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Navigate through chapters using the sidebar. Each section contains explanations and interactive 3D visualizations that you can manipulate to explore concepts.</p>
            <p>For the best experience, we recommend completing chapters in order, as concepts build upon each other.</p>
